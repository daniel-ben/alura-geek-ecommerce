# AluraGeek - Ecommerce

This website was made during a code challenge at Alura. The goal is to make the students create a website based on a given [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/itJpWbvHxSUcUeMPy1lmof/AluraGeek?node-id=0%3A1) template. We can use any technology we want.

I'll take this oportunity to learn Typescript, practice what I've been studying with React and try my best to make a clean code. I'll also record my steps and decisions here.
