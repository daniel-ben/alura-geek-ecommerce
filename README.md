# AluraGeek - eCommerce

This website was made during a code challenge at Alura. The goal is to make the students create a website based on a given [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/itJpWbvHxSUcUeMPy1lmof/AluraGeek?node-id=0%3A1) template. We can use any technology we want.

This time we were given the task to make an eCommerce website for a company called AluraGeek that sells geek products. The website will have a home page with a list of products and sales, a login page, a page with a list of products, a page with more details about a specific product, and a page to add more products for admin users.

I'll take this oportunity to learn Typescript, practice what I've been studying with React and try my best to make a clean code. I'll also record my steps and decisions here.
